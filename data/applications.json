Functioning as an engine for fundraising, the Crowdstaking Application allows users to help in funding various cooperative projects while also being able to withdraw their initial stake in full at any time. The development of tools such as the Crowdstaking Application is crucial for attracting users who are drawn to non-financialized forms of coordination enabled by blockchains.\n\nAt the Breadchain Cooperative, we want to prove that the economic design space enabled by crypto allows for the development of innovative, sustainable methods of funding and co-governing resources that were not possible before.\n\nThis grant will help us to develop additional solidarity primitives in order to establish a vibrant ecology of projects, applications, and individuals who collectively govern resources.\n\nPlease visit [here](https://breadchain.mirror.xyz/nwQx4CqPAcwZ5zSNB2_K25N1quOF1NGcKaYcS3S33CA) for an in-depth walkthrough of the Crowdstaking Application. \n",

            "answer": "To drive network growth - web3 ecosystems need novel funding mechanisms that help grow a network of diverse + high quality dApps, infrastructure and public goods. \n\nThe teams, communities, and founders that build and maintain these public goods need funding that corresponds to the value that they’re bringing to the ecosystem.\n\nOur implementation of Conviction Voting improves on existing systems of grant funding specifically for established public goods projects that need ongoing funding for products / services they’re building. It does this by algorithmically encouraging bottom-up governance of grant funding, and by reducing governance and administrative friction that bog down most other allocation methods.\n\nWe chose Conviction Voting as our first funding mechanism because we believe it’s the most proven and underserved funding mechanism in web3. However, our v2 platform design is optimized for running many different types of funding mechanisms and many instances of the same funding mechanism running at the same time. We did this by:\n\n- Simplifying and modularizing the Community Covenant contract\n- Using Allo Protocol v2 as our funding mechanism framework, which lets us easily implement other Allo funding mechanisms to our platform as we grow.\n\nBy the end of 2024 we are aiming for the following growth metrics\n\n- 5+ ecosystems with active gardens communities\n- 10+ active gardens communities\n- 500+ active community members\n- $100k distributed through gardens v2 Funding Pools\n- $1M+ TVL - measured in Funding Pool token balances of all gardens v2 communities\n\nThe ultimate mission of Gardens is to help communities and public goods builders allocate resources more efficiently and with greater ROI. Gardens v1 was a launchpad that let open source software projects in web3 experiment with a new robust + flexible funding mechanism - Conviction Voting. Our goal with gardens v2 is to expand its usefulness beyond just the pioneers of web3 to all open source software projects, and then eventually to anyone building Public Goods in both the digital and real world.\n\nGardens is 100% community-owned, with all our funding to date coming from 1Hive funding proposals, grants, donations, hackathon winnings, and the visibility and support of our passionate users. We’d like to remain community-owned forever.",

          "description": "# past\nLexClinic alpha was a successful minimum viable potential-charity:\n\n1. We walked many new web3 projects through our $300 legal risk checklist and 2 hour legal information session based on the project's answers to the checklist:\n\n* This enabled these web3 projects to make informed decisions about their legal future. \n\n* It also taught law students how to properly interview projects about their legal needs and how to expand past not just thinking rationally about what the law means, which is taught in law schools, but also thinking creatively about how to ethically achieve the project's goals.\n\n* After going through the checklist, many projects progressed onto starting the 501(c)3 charity designation process with the *pro bono* support of one of the best law firms in our industry.\n\n2. We did some open source general legal research at low cost:\n\n* An obvious value-add since law students already spend quite a bit of their time doing legal research. The Clinic's research opportunities exposed them to key players in our industry as well as key concepts in our industry.\n\n3. Big picture: \n\n* We figured out how to further our core value that **law is a public good** but is in a tragedy of the commons that needs to be rejuvenated. \n\n* We will likely be considered an educational charity when we are ready to make the request during our transition to beta, while also doing actual applied work that has a big prosocial impact on prosocial impact projects.\n\n4. Insights:\n\n* After speaking with and learning from our friends at Endaoment, we realized that the accounting requirements for 501(c)3 status are too advanced for our alpha stage, and that we needed an accountable managerial layer in order to meet 501(c)3 requirements.\n\n* Trade schools teach with journeyperson apprenticeships, and in many jurisdictions this is still how lawyers learn to practice law. We can take this applied learning methodology and use it to low-cost help prosocial impact projects in an environment where legal costs are often unethically high.\n\n* We do not offer any confidentiality, and all projects work together in the open. This helps ensure projects do not try, on purpose or accidentally, to get legal services at the Clinic.\n\n* We learned to use the Clinic itself for legal engineering experiments, so-called dogfooding, as a safe way to take on applied legal engineering work. For instance, our [Hats Tree](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/10/26) that is continuing to be built as we transition from alpha to beta.\n\nWe now have barred lawyers who graduated from LexClinic alpha! By being apprentices at the Clinic, they are Web3 literate lawyers.\n\n# present\nWe are now transitioning to LexClinic beta:\n\n1. We have the Ixian Tech law firm managing the Clinic, so that we can ensure projects do not detrimentally rely on students.\n\n* One of the problems we experienced during the alpha stage was that we should in no way interfere with student academic performance while also being responsible with projects.\n\n2. The Clinic is now a $300/yr subscription or invite Patronage managed by Hats Protocol.\n\n* This makes onboarding simpler, and in theory should be easier to build out as a protocol so we can continue being as decentralized as is reasonable.\n\n3. Houses are deemphasized for now.\n\n* Critical mass was not big enough in the alpha stage to develop a 'surname legacy' culture, but we did successfully integrate existing projects as houses into the Clinic that wanted to use the Clinic's protocol for business logic, so we'll continue doing that.\n\n4. We are going to administer the [inverted-precedent](https://github.com/lexclinic/Grants) legal engineering grant invention.\n\n* The Clinic's test pilots should be a good fit for properly testing this important rough consensus and wisdom cultivating over time concept. \n\n5. We are going to expand our open sourcing of Hats Protocol resources.\n\n* For instance, during this transition from alpha to beta, we have developed a mutual consent Hats system, including the [boilerplate](https://claim.hatsprotocol.xyz/10/26.5.1) legal that handles novel liabilities because of the Remote Procedure Call \"RPC\" nature of \"Ethereum Virtual Machine\" EVM systems.",

          "description": "#### **Introduction**\n\nThe Global Decentralized Cleanup Initiative is an innovative project designed to leverage blockchain technology for environmental cleanup efforts worldwide. It encourages and rewards individuals and communities for participating in and reporting environmental cleanups. \n\n#### **Objectives**\n- To motivate global participation in environmental cleanups through digital incentives.\n- To create a verifiable, transparent system for reporting and recognizing cleanup efforts.\n- To launch a successful pilot program as a model for global scalability.\n\n#### **DEMO Phase**\n\n### **WHAT**\n\nThe demo phase of the Global Decentralized Cleanup Initiative invites participants to engage in cleanup activities and document their efforts. This early stage aims to test the participation process and prepare for a blockchain-based reward system. Participants must submit evidence of their cleanup, including photos and, if seeking a refund for materials, receipts of supplies.\n\n### **WHY**\n\n- **Testing and Refinement**: Gather feedback for a user-friendly platform.\n- **Community Building**: Early participants form the core of an environmentally conscious community.\n- **Impact Demonstration**: Show the effectiveness of cleanup activities to attract support.\n- **Blockchain Preparation**: Lay the groundwork for future blockchain integration by collecting data on engagements.\n\n### **HOW**\n\n1. **Cleanup Activity**: Clean a chosen local area, individually or in a group.\n2. **Documentation**: Take a photo to show the cleanup's impact.\n3. **Cleanup Registration**: Complete a [form on Tally](https://tally.so/r/wzDJrk) with your details, cleanup photo, and supplies receipt if applicable.\n4. **Receive NFT certificate either on your email or your wallet, depending on data you are willing to provide.\n\nThis phase is crucial for shaping the initiative, combining community action with technology for a cleaner planet.\n\n#### **ALPHA Phase**\n\nThe Decentralized Cleanup is going to grow in NFT rewards direction, providing users with evolving NFTs where users’ can gain Impact Points with every cleanup they did and register. The NFT they have evolves then, bringing them to next level.\nThrough a dApp that we have in mind, users identify and report cleanup needs, submitting evidence to earn evolving dynamic NFTs. An interactive map facilitates the discovery and selection of cleanup sites.\n\n#### **Request for Funding**\n\nWe seek funding to support the development and implementation of the DApp, community engagement efforts, and the logistical aspects of the pilot program. This includes technology development, marketing, and operational expenses to ensure the project's success and scalability.\n\n#### **First Activity and Results**\n\n- Created [Telegram group](https://t.me/DecentralizedCleanup) for closer work with the audience and as a temporary support channel.\n- On a base of collaboration with ReFi Phangan and GreenPill Phangan organized [first cleanup](https://x.com/decentracleanup/status/1771208213146354120?s=61) on Koh Phangan, Thailand.\n- Established [collaboration with Highly Artistic](https://x.com/DecentraCleanup/status/1771065177376805219?s=20) every Monthly Earth Day.\n- [Refunded first cleanup supplies](https://x.com/decentracleanup/status/1770361465196949806?s=61) based on receipt provided.\n\n#### **Conclusion**\n\nThe Global Decentralized Cleanup Initiative offers an innovative solution to environmental challenges by combining blockchain technology with community-driven cleanup efforts. By reaching global expansion, this project aims to create a sustainable, impactful model for environmental stewardship that encourages participation through digital innovation and rewards.",

          "description": "#### **Introduction**\n\nThe Global Decentralized Cleanup Initiative is an innovative project designed to leverage blockchain technology for environmental cleanup efforts worldwide. It encourages and rewards individuals and communities for participating in and reporting environmental cleanups. \n\n#### **Objectives**\n- To motivate global participation in environmental cleanups through digital incentives.\n- To create a verifiable, transparent system for reporting and recognizing cleanup efforts.\n- To launch a successful pilot program as a model for global scalability.\n\n#### **DEMO Phase**\n\n### **WHAT**\n\nThe demo phase of the Global Decentralized Cleanup Initiative invites participants to engage in cleanup activities and document their efforts. This early stage aims to test the participation process and prepare for a blockchain-based reward system. Participants must submit evidence of their cleanup, including photos and, if seeking a refund for materials, receipts of supplies.\n\n### **WHY**\n\n- **Testing and Refinement**: Gather feedback for a user-friendly platform.\n- **Community Building**: Early participants form the core of an environmentally conscious community.\n- **Impact Demonstration**: Show the effectiveness of cleanup activities to attract support.\n- **Blockchain Preparation**: Lay the groundwork for future blockchain integration by collecting data on engagements.\n\n### **HOW**\n\n1. **Cleanup Activity**: Clean a chosen local area, individually or in a group.\n2. **Documentation**: Take a photo to show the cleanup's impact.\n3. **Cleanup Registration**: Complete a [form on Tally](https://tally.so/r/wzDJrk) with your details, cleanup photo, and supplies receipt if applicable.\n4. **Receive NFT certificate either on your email or your wallet, depending on data you are willing to provide.\n\nThis phase is crucial for shaping the initiative, combining community action with technology for a cleaner planet.\n\n#### **ALPHA Phase**\n\nThe Decentralized Cleanup is going to grow in NFT rewards direction, providing users with evolving NFTs where users’ can gain Impact Points with every cleanup they did and register. The NFT they have evolves then, bringing them to next level.\nThrough a dApp that we have in mind, users identify and report cleanup needs, submitting evidence to earn evolving dynamic NFTs. An interactive map facilitates the discovery and selection of cleanup sites.\n\n#### **Request for Funding**\n\nWe seek funding to support the development and implementation of the DApp, community engagement efforts, and the logistical aspects of the pilot program. This includes technology development, marketing, and operational expenses to ensure the project's success and scalability.\n\n#### **First Activity and Results**\n\n- Created [Telegram group](https://t.me/DecentralizedCleanup) for closer work with the audience and as a temporary support channel.\n- On a base of collaboration with ReFi Phangan and GreenPill Phangan organized [first cleanup](https://x.com/decentracleanup/status/1771208213146354120?s=61) on Koh Phangan, Thailand.\n- Established [collaboration with Highly Artistic](https://x.com/DecentraCleanup/status/1771065177376805219?s=20) every Monthly Earth Day.\n- [Refunded first cleanup supplies](https://x.com/decentracleanup/status/1770361465196949806?s=61) based on receipt provided.\n\n#### **Conclusion**\n\nThe Global Decentralized Cleanup Initiative offers an innovative solution to environmental challenges by combining blockchain technology with community-driven cleanup efforts. By reaching global expansion, this project aims to create a sustainable, impactful model for environmental stewardship that encourages participation through digital innovation and rewards.",

The DAO Coalition intends to help shed a light on some of these matters, by tapping into the insights and opinions of the various DAO communities, and advocating on behalf of them.\n\nProudly founded by LexDAO, ATX DAO, Lobby3 and PAC DAO.\n\n## impact\n\nAs we pursue 501(c)(4) status, to become a social welfare organization and properly advocate on behalf of the DAO ecosystem, we will focus on building and maintaining repositories for interdata exchange between keystone governance primitives and integrations, such as Snapshot voting strategies and Hats Protocol Eligibility Modules. \n\n* Helped catalyze this [Open Civics genesis round](https://x.com/omniharmonic/status/1719120203701784908).\n\n* Created the [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org) strategy for [Hats Protocol](https://hatsprotocol.xyz/) and are maintaining it at https://github.com/daocoa/snapshot-strategies . (Check out https://snapshot.org/#/makerspace.eth/ for a project using the integration.) \n\n* Finalizing the [Gitcoin Passport](https://passport.gitcoin.co/#/welcome) module for Hats Protocol and will maintain it at https://github.com/daocoa/gitcoin-passport-eligibility .\n\n* Expect to have 501(c)(4) status in Q1 2024 -- so any day now! -- and can then begin lobbying activities.\n\n## get involved\n\nIf you are curious about working with DAO Coalition, or representing your DAO or onchain organization in our collective efforts, please contact us at https://www.daocoalition.org/team .\n\nSoon, you'll be able to self-mint a human verified hat and vote on polls about DAO policy and regulation.\n\n## hackathon history\n\nWe discovered the Hats x Snapshot and Hats x Gitcoin Passport interdata needs and developers who can easily solve it at https://app.buidlbox.io/projects/allonet . We spent the time at that hackathon planning to execute over a few months.\n\nHats x Snapshot finished for Hats Season 1 https://quests.com/p/01HHTDF73B4QQZQSDF4P3C1F8E and Hats x Gitcoin Passport is finishing for Hats Season 2. \n\nWe were thinking about Allo next, but with PGN shutting down we might prioritize Hypercerts next. We need an update on Allo v2 though, maybe at the Consensus hackathon.\n\n",

That is what Abundance Protocol is building towards. Such a vision seems far off into the future, but we believe it is within reach.\n\nTo achieve that we are building a Public Goods Funding mechanism that is based on Value Consensus. What is Value Consensus? The most effective mechanism in crypto for funding public goods right now is the Consensus Mechanism - over $1T in value distributed to miners/stakers who provide the common good of network security to the network.\n\nSo what if we took this powerful mechanism and expanded it to all types of common and public good? If the community could come to consensus on what it valued and therefore could  credibly determine the impact of public goods for the community?  (see whitepaper: https://whitepaper.abundance.id)\n\nThis year we released The Abundance Economy book, outlining the vision of an economy where people can thrive by creating impact. It is available as a public good (aka for free) at https://book.abundance.id\n\nWe are now in the early stages of developing the Impact App (https://impact.abundance.id) - a Farcaster client that aims to leverage network effects (and the wealth of data from the open social graph) to allow any community and ecosystem fund what matters to them. It would also allow anyone to focus on impact creation and be rewarded seamlessly through social media tools they already use daily.",

Users can run it locally, use it to edit their project, and then share it with the community using IP-NFTs for data discoverability, and decentralized data exchange networks like IPFS to share data itself.\n\n[![Multiuser](https://bafybeibdidgnutcuhqodxkvnh3qpecugyu6a7p6rvk7w36jwe5m4mtotty.ipfs.w3s.link/Federated.png)](https://twitter.com/LunCoSim/status/1679031437780201472)\n\n## Why Web3?\n\nWeb3 technology allows decentralization, which is crucial as engineering work is often dispersed across various teams. \n\nThe most common approach to knowledge sharing is email, which, while universal, is not the most efficient form of data exchange in today's digital age. On the other hand, Web3 provides advanced tools for file sharing and data exchange.\n\n![Multiuser](https://bafybeifuursjotnrriuy7sh2r7gf4k7mc4ob47nkmjnqj5h3m336a7moum.ipfs.w3s.link/Screenshot_20231105_151305.jpg)\n\n\n## Impact\n\nThrough LunCo, we aim to:\n\n- **Lower engineering costs,** by making knowledge sharing much more efficient\n- **Democratize the engineering landscape**, providing equal access to manufacturing software for all\n- **Foster a global engineering community** encouraging data and technology transfer across domains\n- Serve as a **repository of high-quality data for engineering AI**\n\n![](https://bafybeieyvd2guylnjom7lnyqcudcawsjnc2k5srr7a3j53jtswo6syww2m.ipfs.w3s.link/Screenshot_20231105_152202.jpg)\n\n\n## Main sybsystems\n\n- Solar Energy Design Subsystem\n- Networking sybsystems\n- Lunar Opensource Lander\n- AI Space Engineer\n\n## Inspired by\n\n1.

          "description": "**Event Horizon is a public good, public-access metagovernance pool...** designed to enfranchise the long tail distribution of tens of thousands of smaller voters found within the citizenry of every DAO.\n\n**Metrics & Traction:** Event Horizon is already live within both the Gitcoin and Arbitrum ecosystems and has mobilized >$25,000,000 of voting power across ~250 proposals on over 6 DAOs all on behalf of retail voters at no cost to the user. This is $25,000,000 of voice amplification for the low-capital, high-conviction citizens which would never have been possible prior to the Event Horizon's product. \n\nMost recently, Event Horizon officially partnered with Gitcoin to leverage the Gitcoin Passport and received a 150,000 GTC community delegation:\n\n [Announcement Tweet](https://x.com/EventHorizonDAO/status/1773075757759127818?s=20 )\n\nEvent Horizon is in the process of conducting a similar proposal, inclusive of Gitcoin's Passport solution, for the Arbitrum community: \n\n[Arbitrum Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-to-a-public-access-public-good-citizen-enfranchisement-pool-through-event-horizon/21523)\n\n# More Information:\n**Most DAOs face a problem:** Not enough people care to vote, and those who do care don’t have much influence. Today, typical DAO voter and token participation hovers around 1%. That means 99% of a DAO's governance thought capital is not being used to improve the DAO's collective cognition. Voting when you only have, say, $100 worth of voting power, simply doesn’t make sense, it’s a drop in the bucket. Sitting out governance proposals is, unfortunately, the rational decision but collectively makes everyone worse off. However, given that the strength of the DAO is directly related to the number of participants having their voices heard by the community, this problem needs to be addressed.\n\n**Solution:** Voting is the first step to onboarding new DAO contributors and/or delegates. But without meaningful voting authority, new and existing DAO citizens will remain sidelined and the DAO will remain worse off compared to competitors who optimize top of funnel. \n\nEvent Horizon allows DAO citizens to vote with meaningful authority though is novel governance mechanism: [Implicit Delegation](https://medium.com/hvax/implicit-delegation-event-horizons-governance-solution-3815d61ded12) \n\nEvent Horizon slots into the broader DAO ecosystem in a similar fashion to a standard delegate. However, rather than the pool voting based on the decision of one individual or group, it votes with the collective cognition of hundreds of individual Event Horizon Voter Pass holders. This serves two functions:\n\n1. **Enfranchise Community Citizens:** It provides a clear and designated voice for smaller, retail voters.\n\n2. **Increase Meaningful Retail Participation:** It drives participation through a game theoretic process called Implicit Delegation. Whether 10 people show up to vote, or 10,000 people do, the full retail voter allotment is mobilized in support of the community’s desired outcome:\n\n*When participation is low…* each voter receives a larger slice of the public access pie. This means the fewer people there are voting, the more incentive there is for someone new to come and participate.\n\n*When participation is high…* there are more voters splitting the same pie, however, retail participation is high, which is a great win for the ecosystem.\n\nThis is all done without the need to pay delegates with inflationary token rewards, which would attract the wrong crowd anyway. Event Horizon’s model attracts people strictly interested in governance, not payment.\n\n**DAO Benefits:** From a DAO perspective, Implicit Delegation brings the many great ideas and voices from the long-tail distribution of low-capital community members to the surface. We like to say that the best ideas in an ecosystem are often held in the minds of individuals with $50 in governance voice, so we need a better platform for these ideas to be heard.\n\n\n**Delegate Benefits:** Governance is hard. It is nearly impossible to review, react to, and care about every individual proposal. EH functions as a hive mind to solve this problem. If there are 3 proposals (Gaming, Lending, and Partnership) 100 citizens may show up to vote for each, but the exact voter body may be entirely different each time, with those caring about gaming participating in the gaming proposal, and so on and so forth for the other proposal topics.\n\n# How it Works:\n\n| **Step 0 – Mint:** Any citizen of the DAO ecosystem may [mint](https://eventhorizon.vote/mint) a free voter pass.\n\n| **Step 1 – Duplication:** Once a delegation is established, Event Horizon begins automatically duplicating all base DAO proposals within its own [metagovernance dashboard](https://eventhorizon.vote/vote).\n\n| **Step 2 – Metagovernance:** Retail voters may mint a free voter pass and begin voting to decide how the retail enfranchisement pool is mobilized in the base DAO proposal.\n\n| **Step 3 – Base DAO Voting:** 24 hours prior to the closure of the base DAO proposal, the Event Horizon metagovernance proposal closes. Event Horizon then automatically pushes the consensus decision established by the retail community during the metagovernance proposal into the base DAO proposal.\n\nThe end result is, **Citizens who vote through Event Horizon vote with a significant vote multiple**. We've often seen multiples upwards of 10,000x and roughly $40k voting power per voter. This provides new users a strong incentive to show up and vote.\n\n## Voter fatigue and self-selection\nImplicit Delegation has other elegant benefits. \n\nVoter fatigue is a well-known problem for delegates. It's a lot of work to carefully parse every new proposal, track the continuously evolving discussion, follow every iteration, and then express a well-written opinion on the matter when it comes time to vote. Add to the mix that many delegates are delegates on multiple DAOs and voter fatigue becomes quite understandable. \n\n*Given that Implicit Delegation's sole incentive is governance authority, it attracts people not interested in capital, but in governance*. So our model self-selects for governance nerds. \n\nBut there's an additional layer to this. Given the only incentive is governance authority, *Event Horizon voters only vote on what they have strong opinions on*. If there's a DeFi proposal, DeFi nerds come out of the woodwork. If there's a gaming proposal put up to Snapshot, then only the gaming nerds show up to vote. But the block is fully utilized every time. This ensures that we have 100% token participation every time, driven entirely by those underrepresented Citizens most interested in *this particular proposal*. This minimizes voter fatigue and rewards those who care most. \n",

Functioning as an engine for fundraising, the Crowdstaking Application allows users to help in funding various cooperative projects while also being able to withdraw their initial stake in full at any time. The development of tools such as the Crowdstaking Application is crucial for attracting users who are drawn to non-financialized forms of coordination enabled by blockchains.\n\nAt the Breadchain Cooperative, we want to prove that the economic design space enabled by crypto allows for the development of innovative, sustainable methods of funding and co-governing resources that were not possible before.\n\nThis grant will help us to develop additional solidarity primitives in order to establish a vibrant ecology of projects, applications, and individuals who collectively govern resources.\n\nPlease visit [here](https://breadchain.mirror.xyz/nwQx4CqPAcwZ5zSNB2_K25N1quOF1NGcKaYcS3S33CA) for an in-depth walkthrough of the Crowdstaking Application. \n",

          "description": "LunCo collaborates with EcoSynthesisX on Space Data application for Environmental cases\n\n## [Browser version Dev Build](https://alpha.lunco.space)\n\n\n## [Download Dev Build](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim/releases/tag/v0.4.0-dev1)\n\nThe goal of LunCo is to integrate Space & Robotics industry existing models into one Virtual World, allowing collaborative (concurrent) engineering.\n\nIt has an educational mode to onboard students into space engineering and web3 without knowing that they are learning, so it's kind of a Play2Learn mode.\n\nOn the other hand LunCo has a strong social component for engineers, issuing IP-NFT for their designs, allowing sharing CAD and other types of designs easilly and without central authority\n\n\nThe below diagram highlights the overall idea.\n![Multiuser](https://bafybeic5mnsajdsyrszy7ddnoy5uvxhz76usukcnatp5g5exqapqagzcc4.ipfs.w3s.link/Combining%20simulations.png)\n\nLunCo is focused on **Data Sovereignty**, meaning that there is no need for central server. Users can run it locally, use it to edit their project, and then share it with the community using IP-NFTs for data discoverability, and decentralized data exchange networks like IPFS to share data itself.\n\n[![Multiuser](https://bafybeibdidgnutcuhqodxkvnh3qpecugyu6a7p6rvk7w36jwe5m4mtotty.ipfs.w3s.link/Federated.png)](https://twitter.com/LunCoSim/status/1679031437780201472)\n\n## Why Web3?\n\nWeb3 technology allows decentralization, which is crucial as engineering work is often dispersed across various teams. \n\nThe most common approach to knowledge sharing is email, which, while universal, is not the most efficient form of data exchange in today's digital age. On the other hand, Web3 provides advanced tools for file sharing and data exchange.\n\n![Multiuser](https://bafybeifuursjotnrriuy7sh2r7gf4k7mc4ob47nkmjnqj5h3m336a7moum.ipfs.w3s.link/Screenshot_20231105_151305.jpg)\n\n\n## Impact\n\nThrough LunCo, we aim to:\n\n- **Lower engineering costs,** by making knowledge sharing much more efficient\n- **Democratize the engineering landscape**, providing equal access to manufacturing software for all\n- **Foster a global engineering community** encouraging data and technology transfer across domains\n- Serve as a **repository of high-quality data for engineering AI**\n\n![](https://bafybeieyvd2guylnjom7lnyqcudcawsjnc2k5srr7a3j53jtswo6syww2m.ipfs.w3s.link/Screenshot_20231105_152202.jpg)\n## Roadmap & Features\n\n1. End of 2023 - release of polished version 0.4.0 and 24/7 available main server\n2. Q2 2024 - decent version to start design robotic lunar exploration missions together\n3. Q4 2024 - Launch of Metaverse, extensive building of tool funded by refi activities, e.g. quadratic funding round\n\n## Sample applications\n\n- Design solar power station in space \n- Assess impact of solar panels in the specific project\n- Plan satellite constellations \n- Visualize robotic transportation system\n- Monitoring and controlling of remote agriculture robots\n- Model Closed Loop Biological Life Support Systems\n\n## Inspired by\n\n1.

          "description": "Outcome funding for journalists after their stories create tangible impact\n\n**Problem**\n\nProducing global investigations like the Panama Papers or local stories on community grievances are not sustainable via ad based revenue models. At the same time, such stories uncover new information and often lead to tangible progress on the issue they highlight. Which led us to ask a simple question - instead of having journalists write grant applications for every new story they want to pursue, can we just pay them after their past stories create impact?\n\n**History**\n\nVoiceDeck’s founder Devansh Mehta is a journalist with personal experience of the funding challenges in the media industry. In 2017, he did his master’s in investigative journalism at the Columbia Journalism School, where he worked with newsrooms like the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) that handled the Eurasia region for the Panama Papers. Despite OCCRPs massive impact (over $10 billion in asset seizures, 650+ indictments or arrests and over 1000 investigations or actions) they are unable to capture the value of the impact they create, outside of what is raised through grants.\n\nPost graduation, Devansh worked for 5 years with CGNet Swara, a citizen journalism platform operating in the Maoist affected regions of Central India. Local residents would dial in to a toll-free number and report longstanding community issues, which the organization would forward to government officials for their resolution. CGNet has solved over 1500 issues reported by the community but is unable to successfully raise grants without English speakers on the team.\n\n**Solution**\n\nIn the case of both OCCRP and CGNet, the root of the problem is same: the optimal strategy for nonprofit newsrooms is to sell the past impact from their stories multiple times, to as many funders as they can get an audience with, making impact marketing more important than its creation for fundraising.\n\nAt app.voicedeck.org, we record each impact from a journalist story as Hypercerts on Optimism (these are a web3 protocol for impact certificates). After the Hypercert is fully bought out by funders, newsrooms cannot raise any more money until they create their next impact.\n\nWe think this solution is superior to existing grant funding models for 3 reasons\n\n1. Moves past reputation or brand based giving. If you like the impact described in a Hypercert, buy it! Doesn't matter whether or not you have heard of the newsroom.\n\n2. Even with stellar marketing teams, newsrooms cannot raise more money than impact they have created. Each impact has a price and when fully bought out, cannot be sold again.\n\n3. Newsrooms have to account for their impact and have an incentive to stay with their past stories instead of moving on to the next one. Recording their past impact onchain adds discipline and history to their operations.\n\n**Traction**\n\n- After first starting work on this idea in August 2021, we finally launched on Sepolia testnet!  Our pilot tokenized the impact reports of 3 citizen journalism outlets in India. \n\nIf we are maximally successful, newsrooms will regularly mint hypercerts of all outcomes arising from their stories and media funders will purchase them. Our North Star is getting the Panama Papers onchain, a pivotal moment for our industry and the world.\n\n- Our litepaper passed peer review and is due for publication this November in ACM CSCW! https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xPzQnK1bullhLc2VwYbWFdhaqR9a-NQF",

These offerings advance the public goods powered by Web3. \n\nWe have already completed our first pilot where the application (impact miner) was used in Rural India to create a local micro economy around water. Users were rewarded for harvesting and exchanging water and for a range of green jobs. Read more about the pilot from the report prepared by Crypto Council for Innovation: https://docsend.com/view/sqra3t5k7amrjgw7\n\nSimilarly with more funding we will scale these offerings to more regions across Asia, where decentralized peer to peer networks can provide local communities with increase climate resilience and incentives for decarbonizing.

Our aim is to make it easier for NGOs, Social Enterprises, Impact DAOs to digitise their impact creation, fundraising & team management.\n\nOur products and services are geared to make existing organizations effective while making it easier for new organizations to bloom.\n\n# Mission \n\n## Accelerating Resilience and Regeneration\n\nOur mission is two fold, on one side Resilience, with rising climate shocks we will need to defend our water, food, energy supply lines. Defend them from floods, droughts, wildfires and other climate events. \n\nOn the other side is Regeneration. While we build resilience to mitigate climate change and adapt to it, we also need to actively accelerate removal and reduction of GHG by making regenerative life support systems more accessible.\n\n[![Vision-Mission.png](https://i.postimg.cc/TwvFc7BC/Vision-Mission.png)](https://postimg.cc/Y48dr3rW)\n\n# Vision\n\nWe dream of a future where humans finally decouple progress from the current degenerative systems to more regenerative systems. A future where we realize there is no economic wellness without ecological wellness. Like Buckminster Fuller says, what we need is a design revolution, one which will make it possible for Spaceship Earth to work for ALL.\n\n### Accelerating the coordination and creation of credible impact. End to end impact workflow on-chain.\n\n[![End-to-End-Impact-Workflow.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/sD3BL3pR/End-to-End-Impact-Workflow.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/mh62zfXd)\n\n# What we have done since GG20\n\n1. Launch Impact Miner, live in the app store and play store.\n2. Commence development of Impact Foundry (a web app for Impact Funds and Orgs) \n3. Successful integrations with EVM tokens. Previously only Solana compatible tokens could be used to reward bounties and mint Impact Certificates, now you can reward bounties and mint impact certificates on EVM. \n4. Development of 3rd Party Impact Attestation mechanism and integration of the same mechanism with Impact miner and Impact Foundry. The Impact Attestation leverages EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) \n5. Develop user manual for Impact Miner \n6. Commenced onboarding first set of clients to the Impact Miner. \n7. Launched the Pilot end line report with MCV and CCI\n\n# How will we use the funds we raise?\n\n1. Develop impact reporting mechanisms, with integrations to CCN’s metrics garden, Ecological benefits framework (EBF), and few other recognized climate benchmarks. This framework will be integrated with Impact Miner and Impact Foundry \n\n2. Launch Impact Foundry - MVP\nCreate Bounties | Create Proposals | Validation Mechanism | 3rd Party Attestation Mechanism | Org Management (Members, Projects, Treasury) \n\n3. Launch Impact Miner version 1.1 and 1.2\n***Version 1.1*** - Gated bounties for Organizations | Impact Index for Organizations | New improvements to micro tasks mechanisms | Transition to decentralized storage \n\n***Version 1.2***- Improvements to Bounty Discoverability | Conditional Logic for Bounty Workflow | Automatic Validation | New innovations for Mircotasks | Introduce Impact highlights in Citizen Impact Profile \n\n# Timeline:\n\nAugust - October: Launch Foundry MVP \nSeptember - October: Launch Impact Miner Version 1.1 \nNovember - December: Launch Impact Miner Version 1.2\n\n\n# Team\n[![Screenshot-2024-07-27-at-6-25-11-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XYKH2T5F/Screenshot-2024-07-27-at-6-25-11-PM.png)](https://postimg.cc/0zQ0jXc2)\n\n\n# Bio:\n\n***Irthu Suresh*** - Cofounder and CEO.

We have already had success inviting public sector leaders, including [Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike](https://x.com/FundingCommons/status/1815925061762548182), [Mr. Masaaki Taira](https://x.com/TAIRAMASAAKI/status/1815992116537090457) (member of the House of Representatives and leading regulator of web3 and AI in Japan, who participated in a panel with our CEO), and [Audrey Tang, former Minister of Digital Affairs of Taiwan](https://x.com/audreyt).\n\nAdditionally, we are collaborating closely with UNICEF to support projects in Asia that may qualify for the residency application. We are leveraging our partners to provide the stipends necessary for builders from various countries in Asia to join us in Chiang Mai for a 3.5-week experience nurturing public goods developers with mentorship and a supportive environment that can accelerate their work. In turn, our aim is that these local participants will have the ability to work on public goods funding protocols and tools that specifically fit Asian ecosystems.\n\n---\n\n### Calendar of Events in Asia This Year\n\n**5 out of 6 flagship events:**\n\n#### TOKYO CONFERENCE: FtC x DeSci Tokyo\n\n- **Date:** July 24-25\n- **Location:** UN University, Shibuya\n- **Status:** Completed\n\n**Key Metrics:**\n\n- **Total Attendees:** 538\n  - Walk-ins: 218 (72% attendance - 303 registrations)\n  - Speakers: 60\n  - After-party: 239\n- **Twitter Activities During Promotional Period** (June 24 - Aug 2)\n  - 342K organic impressions\n  - 554 reposts\n  - 3.5% engagement rate\n  - 546 new followers (expanding our reach in Japan)\n- **36 Talks Recorded:** *Target launch Aug 15th on YouTube & Spotify*\n- **8 Original Pieces of FtC Content Featuring Key Speakers:** *Target launch Aug-Sept*\n  - Audrey Tang - Pluarality.net\n  - Glen Weyl - Plurality Institution & RxC & Microsoft\n  - Aya Miyaguchi - Ethereal Foundation\n  - Chris Szymczak - UNICEF\n  - Scott Moore - Public Works\n  - Ken Suzuki - University of Tokyo, SmartNews Inc.\n  - Behind the Scenes Video - FtC x DeSci Tokyo\n- **Professional Photos:** Over 4000 professional photos to share with our community to continue social media activities for an additional month.\n- **Traditional Local Media Exposure:**\n  - [YouTube: What is \"Digital Democracy\"?

Our aim is to explore new methods and technologies to better fund the commons in Public Goods and understand the impact and effectiveness of that funding. Also, measuring what is being funded, how effective the funding is, what needs to be built to distribute, allocate, and govern funding, as well as evaluate impact.\n\nIn this experiment, we want to explore the effect on building community, the advantages of collaborative production, receiving feedback, conducting workshops, working with mentors, and rapidly producing products. Production that probably wouldn’t be possible working alone and remote.\n\nWhat makes the Funding the Commons Residency unique is that we focus on the human component first, prioritize creative freedom, promote a safe space, prioritize mental health, foster connections and development, promote learning, and provide a healthier and more regenerative work environment.\n\nWe believe in inspiring growth, continuous education, and upholding values such as gratitude, generosity, teamwork beyond individual projects, inclusiveness, and connection.\n\n---\n\n### Residency Partner Highlight: Pagoda\n\nPagoda starts as a humble assemblage of Asian web3/Ethereum ecosystem builders, thinkers, and leaders. We aspire to be a resilient and interoperable support network that provides change-makers in political, economic, technological, and spiritual sectors with an alternative lifestyle and career path focused on humanitarian care across Asia.\n\nPagoda cultivates high-trust relationships through peer support & mutual care, so that people grow & develop to be better equipped for doing meaningful work in the world.\n\nIn other words, people who spend time in Pagoda tend to develop a sense of belonging, grow more emotional maturity, develop skills & confidence, and find new opportunities to make a beneficial contribution to the world.\n\n**Team:**\n\n- Christopher (The Philippines)\n- Sig (China, based in Chiang Mai)\n- [Songyi Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/songyilee/) (Korea)\n- [Vivian Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viviantp6/) (Taiwan)\n\n---\n\n### Why Chiang Mai?\n\nChiang Mai, known as the \"Rose of the North,\" is a vibrant city in northern Thailand renowned for its rich cultural heritage, natural beauty, and thriving digital nomad community. The city's unique blend of tradition and modernity makes it an ideal location for the Funding the Commons Residency.\n\n**Strength of Chiang Mai:**\n\nChiang Mai’s strengths lie in its ability to blend the old with the new, offering a unique environment where traditional wisdom meets modern innovation.\n\n**Pagoda in Chiang Mai:**\n\nPagoda’s presence in Chiang Mai reinforces our commitment to creating a resilient and interoperable support network across Asia. By hosting the residency in Chiang Mai, Pagoda strengthens its mission to weave the diverse threads of Asia into a united tapestry, fostering a decentralized world that honors our shared heritage and distinct voices.\n\n---\n\n### Key Milestones\n\n- **May - July:** Ideation & Definition of Key Partnerships\n- **July - Aug:** Call for Applications & Collaborations with APAC builder communities to promote residency to high-caliber public goods applicants\n- **Aug 15:** Final Selection of Applicants\n- **Sept 1:** Final Sponsorship / Mentorship Decisions for Track Design\n- **Sept 1 - Oct 7:** Final Production Elements\n- **Oct 7:** Residency Begins\n- **Oct 31:** Residency Ends\n- **Nov 8-9:** FtC Conference in Bangkok - Opportunity to present residency outcomes on stage to 500-700 expected attendees during our flagship conference near the DevCon main location.\n\n---\n\n### Key Considerations & Budget\n\n1) **Manpower:**\n\n- **Production (July - September):**\n  - Residency Organizer: 1 (Remote Full-time)\n  - Logistic Support: 1 (On-site Part-time)\n  - Program Design: 1 (Remote Part-time)\n  - Network Support: 1 (Remote Part-time)\n\n- **During Residency (October):**\n  - Residency Organizer: 1 (On-site Full-time)\n  - Logistic Support: 2 (On-site Part-time)\n  - Facilitation: 2 (On-site Part-time)\n\n2) **Budget (Estimation Only):**\n\n| Category                        | Estimated Cost (USD) |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Accommodation (35 participants + staff) includes venue & equipment rental | $35,000              |\n| Food (35 participants + staff) includes venue & equipment rental         | $15,000              |\n| Travel Expenses                 | $5,000               |\n| Swags & Workshop Materials      | $5,000               |\n| Admin & Staff Support           | $20,000              |\n| Contingency Fund                | $2,000               |\n| Organizational Coordination Fee | $8,000               |\n| **Total Estimated Cost**        | **$90,000**          |\n\n---\n\n### People Curation\n\n**Criteria from the past:**\n\n- Open source contributions\n- Diverse backgrounds and life experiences\n- Willingness to support other builders in a p2p fashion\n- Outcome-oriented: The projects that builders create during the residency\n  - 75% highly technical builders in open-source community\n\n---\n\n### 2023 Residency References\n\n- **Video from 2023 Berlin Residency:** [Watch Here](https://youtu.be/NXrqTm9UBZI)\n- **Video - What is a Funding the Commons Residency:** [Watch Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ToX5EbFLE8&t=9s)\n- **40 Builders Participated**\n- **15 Sponsors / Mentors**\n- **Achievement:** One of the projects incubated during the residency and given its first grant by Funding the Commons post-residency allowed our community member to receive the ETH Next Billion Fellow Award.\n",

By leveraging the FtC community, brand, events, extensive resources from key partners, and a growing builder community, the organization aims to establish a sustainable PGF ecosystem, and shape the discourse around public goods funding. This involves integrating existing public goods funding platforms to build a cohesive infrastructure, allocating resources effectively, and incubating innovative projects.\n\nOur current focus is to bootstrap a virtuous cycle of builders creating and integrating public goods funding infrastructure, and leveraging that infrastructure, in addition to the infrastructure of leading PGF protocols, to fund the next wave of builders.",

          "description": "GrantsScope is pioneering the intersection of data science and AI to empower donors in the web3 public goods funding (PGF). \n\n> Our mission? To revolutionize how donors identify and support grantees during PGF rounds.\n\n**QUICK LINKS**\n- [View latest implementation of GrantsScope](https://grantsscope.streamlit.app/)\n- [GrantsScope details on prior funding and impact on Karma GAP](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/project/grantsscope---grantee-discovery-using-llms)\n\n### The Challenge: \nIn large PGF rounds, where hundreds of grantees vie for attention, the brightest spotlight often falls on those with the strongest marketing. This imbalance creates a cycle where deserving projects may go unnoticed, leading to an uneven distribution of resources and opportunities.\n\n> Information silos create cultural silos\n\n### The Result: \nThis disparity not only places additional burdens on grantees to amplify their visibility but also diverts their focus from creating meaningful impact. As a result, the true potential of PGF is left untapped, and innovation in public goods is stifled.\n\n### Our Solution: GrantsScope\nWe believe in leveling the playing field. GrantsScope harnesses the power of data analytics, machine learning, and advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance project visibility and democratize access to funding. Our experiments are designed to assist donors during quadratic funding rounds on Gitcoin Grants by\n- Providing personalized recommendations, helping donors easily navigate the complexity of PGF rounds.\n- Offering self-discovery tools that empower donors to explore and connect with projects that resonate with their values.\n- Reducing information asymmetry, ensuring donors comprehensively understand the PGF landscape.\n\n### Our Impact: \nHere are the list of apps deployed as part of the project implementation:\n- August 2024: The GG21 version will combine previously experimented features using LLMs and clustering algorithms to offer one-click grantee recommendations to donors. Visit the app at https://grantsscope.streamlit.app/ on or after August 8th after donations begin to explore the functionality\n\n- April 2024: Grantee [discovery tool](https://all-about-gg20.streamlit.app/) through conversational experience to explore 500+ grantees in GG20 participating in 4 OSS and 5 community rounds. See examples [here](https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1786413137220059398), [here](https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1785304850814677129), and [here](https://x.com/RohitMalekar/status/1784869975435456620).\n\n- April 2024: One-click personalized [Personalized Grantee Recommendations](https://gitcoin-cr3.streamlit.app/) for Citizens Round #3 to re-discover the grantees you’ve supported in the past, explore grantees backed by the community who also champion your favorite projects, and uncover similar but previously unknown grantees\n\n- March 2024: From its inception as a Gitcoin Round in late 2021 to its evolution as Climate Coordination Network, over 400 grassroots climate projects have found the support they need to flourish in the climate round - a visual drill-down [here](https://ccn-impact.streamlit.app/).\n\n- March 2024: [Clustering-based Discovery tool](https://gp-octant.streamlit.app/) for GreenPill Network x Octant Community Round to guide your exploration of projects by picking a project that sparks your curiosity, discovering similar and distinct projects.\n\n- January 2024: PoCs for [Grantee Recommendations Engine](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/concepts-pocs-and-early-results-for-personalized-grantee-recommendations/17469) by tapping into historical donation data and for driving interactive visualization to discover similar projects based on clustering.\n\n- December 2023: [Code-created NFT](https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x4e17da9659cca38ebfd98446d2b404bf94fe9997/1) art to illustrate power of PGF. The art uses a logarithmic scale for brightness to highlight even lesser-known projects, symbolizing their potential to become significant over time.\n\n- December 2023: [2023 Wrapped](https://2023-wrapped-gitcoin.streamlit.app/) with Personalized Grantee Recommendations for Gitcoin Donors.

          "description": "A Home for Changemakers 🔱🌏\nBuilding coordination tech for climate resilience & regeneration 🤝\n\n# Introduction to Atlantis\n\nFounded in 2022, Atlantis is a borderless peer to peer impact network.\nWe build a range of tools for initiating, implementing and reporting the impact of climate and social projects. Our aim is to make it easier for NGOs, Social Enterprises, Impact DAOs to digitise their impact creation, fundraising & team management.\n\nOur products and services are geared to make existing organizations effective while making it easier for new organizations to bloom.\n\n# Mission \n\n## Accelerating Resilience and Regeneration\n\nOur mission is two fold, on one side Resilience, with rising climate shocks we will need to defend our water, food, energy supply lines. Defend them from floods, droughts, wildfires and other climate events. \n\nOn the other side is Regeneration. While we build resilience to mitigate climate change and adapt to it, we also need to actively accelerate removal and reduction of GHG by making regenerative life support systems more accessible.\n\n[![Vision-Mission.png](https://i.postimg.cc/TwvFc7BC/Vision-Mission.png)](https://postimg.cc/Y48dr3rW)\n\n# Vision\n\nWe dream of a future where humans finally decouple progress from the current degenerative systems to more regenerative systems. A future where we realize there is no economic wellness without ecological wellness. Like Buckminster Fuller says, what we need is a design revolution, one which will make it possible for Spaceship Earth to work for ALL.\n\n### Accelerating the coordination and creation of credible impact. End to end impact workflow on-chain.\n\n[![End-to-End-Impact-Workflow.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/sD3BL3pR/End-to-End-Impact-Workflow.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/mh62zfXd)\n\n# What we have done since GG20\n\n1. Launch Impact Miner, live in the app store and play store.\n2. Commence development of Impact Foundry (a web app for Impact Funds and Orgs) \n3. Successful integrations with EVM tokens. Previously only Solana compatible tokens could be used to reward bounties and mint Impact Certificates, now you can reward bounties and mint impact certificates on EVM. \n4. Development of 3rd Party Impact Attestation mechanism and integration of the same mechanism with Impact miner and Impact Foundry. The Impact Attestation leverages EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) \n5. Develop user manual for Impact Miner \n6. Commenced onboarding first set of clients to the Impact Miner. \n7. Launched the Pilot end line report with MCV and CCI\n\n# How will we use the funds we raise?\n\n1. Develop impact reporting mechanisms, with integrations to CCN’s metrics garden, Ecological benefits framework (EBF), and few other recognized climate benchmarks. This framework will be integrated with Impact Miner and Impact Foundry \n\n2. Launch Impact Foundry - MVP\nCreate Bounties | Create Proposals | Validation Mechanism | 3rd Party Attestation Mechanism | Org Management (Members, Projects, Treasury) \n\n3. Launch Impact Miner version 1.1 and 1.2\n***Version 1.1*** - Gated bounties for Organizations | Impact Index for Organizations | New improvements to micro tasks mechanisms | Transition to decentralized storage \n\n***Version 1.2***- Improvements to Bounty Discoverability | Conditional Logic for Bounty Workflow | Automatic Validation | New innovations for Mircotasks | Introduce Impact highlights in Citizen Impact Profile \n\n# Timeline:\n\nAugust - October: Launch Foundry MVP \nSeptember - October: Launch Impact Miner Version 1.1 \nNovember - December: Launch Impact Miner Version 1.2\n\n\n# Team\n[![Screenshot-2024-07-27-at-6-25-11-PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XYKH2T5F/Screenshot-2024-07-27-at-6-25-11-PM.png)](https://postimg.cc/0zQ0jXc2)\n\n\n# Bio:\n\n***Irthu Suresh*** - Cofounder and CEO.

As such, our advancement of the Asian public goods ecosystem is rooted in this context.\n\n## Research\n\nIn 2024, we produced 2 research reports: [State of ReFi](https://carboncopy.news/reports/The%20State%20of%20ReFi%20Report%202024.pdf) and [Impact DePIN](https://carboncopy.news/reports/The%20Impact%20DePIN%20Report%202024.pdf). Both reports prominently feature Web3 public goods in the ecological and social impact, including Asian projects like [Arkreen](https://carboncopy.news/project/arkreen/).\n\nIn 2025, we plan to produce new editions of the same two reports. This time, however, we want to place a specific emphasis on geography. Each report will map out the ReFi/Web3 impact ecosystem by region.\n\n## A source of truth for ReFi/Web3 impact as a public good\n\nOne of CARBON Copy's core features is a curated database of ReFi/Web3 impact projects. There are already more than 250 projects in it and we are working hard to connect more data sources (fundraising, impact, etc.). \n\nFor Asian ReFi/Web3 impact projects, we think this database will be particularly useful because it will allow them to a) establish reputation, and b) be part of the larger effort to advocate for Web3's potential for ecological and social impact.\n\nAt the same time, this central source of truth can help investors, journalists, and other potential stakeholders become familiar with the space and the overall value of public goods.\n\n## Transition to a community-managed database\n\nTo make the database a true public good, we think it should be managed by the community. We envision an approach where projects in the DB can \"claim\" their profile by minting an NFT and paying a \"skin in the game\" fee. All revenue would go directly to the community treasury (minus a small percentage to CARBON Copy for prior work done). NFT holders will get governance rights and will be the ultimate decision-makers regarding the future of the DB and how the treasury is utilized. We will also open-source the code-base and transfer ownership to the community.\n\nFor Asian projects, we see this as a great opportunity to participate in a public good with positive externalities.\n\nWe haven't settled on the exact community approach, but it is a critical part of our roadmap over the next 12 months.\n\n## Promotion\n\nWe actively track the happenings in the ReFi/Web3 impact space and add them to our news feed and weekly recaps. This helps us promote the work that these projects are doing and, ultimately, highlights the value of public goods. We are also connecting impact metrics to project profile pages, which gives projects a platform to demonstrate and promote the impact that they're making.\n\nFor Asian projects, we see this as an effective way for them to draw attention to the work being done in the region.",

          "description": "We fill the information void in Web3 regenerative finance (ReFi) by providing a combination of news, education, expert analysis, industry reports, and project evaluation to help industry stakeholders better understand the space and to get projects more exposure.\n\nA core part of this is our comprehensive, curated ReFi company database. Each company has its own profile page complete with contact info, news, media coverage, content feed, token and fundraising data, and more. Each category in our taxonomy also has its own dedicated page showing aggregated data.\n\nWe are also developing a suite of educational tools to help projects expand and promote their regenerative impact. The first tool is a regenerative self-assessment survey based on a framework developed by Kate Bennett.\n\n# The ReFi Project Database\n\nOur database is a curated mapping of the Web3 regenerative finance space. We hope it will serve as a source of truth for the space and help new projects, in particular, establish an online footprint.\n\n## Features\n\nAll of the projects are accessible in one paged list:\n\n![ReFi project listing](https://carboncopy.news/images/db-article-list.png)\n\nEach project has its own dedicated profile page, including direct integration with Karma GAP milestones:\n\n![Project profile page](https://carboncopy.news/images/db-article-project.jpeg)\n\nEach category in our taxonomy has its own dedicated page with aggregated data:\n\n![Category page](https://carboncopy.news/images/db-article-category.jpg)\n\n# Other Activities\n\n**Industry Reports** - We released the 2024 editions of our cornerstone industry report, [The State of ReFi](https://carboncopy.news/reports/state-of-refi-2024/), in February in coordination with ReFi DAO and [The Impact DePIN Report](https://carboncopy.news/reports/impact-depin-2024/) in July in coordination with Arkreen, Switch Electric, and Shamba Network.\n\n**Regenerative Self-Assessment** - We have launched a survey based on the research of [Kate Bennett](https://au.linkedin.com/in/ktlbennett) to help ReFi/Web3 projects become more regenerative in their organisation and impact. \n\n**Articles & Interviews** - We are slowly building a team of writers that produce rich analytical articles on ReFi topics, with a specific focus on localised impact. Example: [Exploring ReFi's Potential in Nigeria](https://carboncopy.news/features/exploring-refi-potential-nigeria/)\n\n**X Spaces** - We have started to host monthly X Spaces around topics relevant to the ReFi space. We've so far discussed the GG20 Climate Round with Climate Coordination Network, the Impact DePIN Report with Arkreen, Switch Electric, and Shamba Network, and the launch of our project database with Pranav Khanna. \n\n**Weekly ReFi recaps** - We aggregate the news, wins, content, and thoughts from the ReFi space each week into a single article so stakeholders can stay up to do with what's happening. Example: [This Week in ReFi: July 20th-26th](https://carboncopy.news/this-week-in-refi/july-20th-26th-2024/)\n\n**ReFi News Feed** - We aggregate news from across the ReFi space into a single RSS feed that anyone can subscribe to or integrate into their projects. As the ReFi space grows, we see this as an important source of truth for crypto and tech media outlets.\n\n# Roadmap\n\nLooking forward, we are currently working on the following:\n\n## 1) Impact metric integration on project profile pages\n\nAt the heart of our mission is the desire to help ReFi projects demonstrate and promote their impact. To that end, we are working towards integrating impact data directly on the project profile and category profile pages.\n\n## 2) ReFi Dashboard\n\nWith project data integrated, it will allow us to put together an aggregated dataset of impact across the ReFi space.\n\n## 3) Nouns-style community for database management\n\nWe want the ReFi project database to remain a public good. As such, we are aiming for a community approach where decisions regarding the database are not made by us.\n\n## 4) 2025 editions of the State of ReFi and Impact DePIN reports\n\nWe aim to use this year's reports plus the data we are aggregating to produce richer, more insightful reports in 2025.\n\n## 5) Latin American and Southeast Asian content\n\nWe are looking to expand the geographic scope of our content and offer analysis from wherever ReFi is making impact.\n\n# Links\n\n**ReFi Project DB** - [https://carboncopy.news/projects/](https://carboncopy.news/projects/)\n\n**Regenerative Self-Assessment** - [https://carboncopy.news/regenerative-assessment/](https://carboncopy.news/regenerative-assessment/)\n\n**Discord** - [https://discord.gg/53TpqNgPC5](https://discord.gg/53TpqNgPC5)\n\n**CARBON Copy RSS Feed** - [https://carboncopy.news/feed.xml](https://carboncopy.news/feed.xml)\n\n**ReFi News RSS Feed** - [https://api.carboncopy.news/feed](https://api.carboncopy.news/feed)",

          "description": "Minibridge is a \"zero-fee\" cross-chain tool that offers multi-chain support for BTC/EVM/non-EVM and features such as fast transactions. It was developed by the Chaineye team specifically for users' small-amount transfer scenarios. Launched for less than half a year, Minibridge has already processed 300K transactions and served 100K Web3 users. In user ratings on dappsheriff.com, Minibridge ranks first among all cross-chain bridge projects and was awarded \"Best Tool of the Year\" in the \"PARTY AWARD 2024\" annual selection by PA News.\n\n\nKey Features\nChaineye was born from the Web3 community and we build products for the community’s needs. To better serve the community, Chaineye has built many free tools such as Onchain Map, CEX Transfer Fees, Multichain Gas, RPC List, etc. The Mini Bridge was designed specifically for retail investors with small-amount cross-chain transfer requests, including the following features:\n1.\t Zero bridge fees: We don’t charge any bridge fees at all. This means users will get the same amount of assets on the destination chains. We are built for retail investors and we believe our community like free services. Only a minimum gas fee on the destination chain is charged.\n2.\tFastest transactions: Our bridge has the fastest bridging experience across all existing bridges. The bridging time largely depends on the confirmation time of source and destination blockchains. We don’t want our users to wait any longer than the evitable blockchain transaction time. \n3.\tDesigned especially for small-amount transfer scenarios such as gas refill, airdrop claiming, moving funds, etc. It helps to save huge money and time for individual investors when doing so.\n4.\tGas swap: Our community wants to use the destination chain directly after bridging. We get it! The gas swap feature allows users to swap a small amount of source chain ETH to the destination chain native gas token. It is very useful for those chains where ETH is not the native gas token such as BNB Chain, Polygon, ZetaChain, ZkFair, Avalanche, Map, Mantle, and Metis. \n5.\tFast Integration: Our team is monitoring the market closely and is ready to integrate the latest blockchains in time. Chaineye Mini Bridge currently supports a total of 24 networks including the latest Blast EVM L2 and Merlin BTC L2 blockchain.\n6.\tOpen API: We have opened the API docs on our documentation site. Any individuals or third parties can go through the API and seamlessly integrate Mini Bridge into their application. Chaineye Mini Bridge works in the same style for both requests from our front-end UI and API endpoints.\n7.\tSecurity: To prevent the potential security concern of smart contracts, we have implemented our bridge in a hybrid style - a combination of EOA and smart contracts. EOA for cross-chain transfers and smart contracts for cross-chain gas swaps. It helps to reduce the possibility of contract exploitation. In addition, we have our entire system audited and scrutinized by our security partners.\n8.\tRewards and Earn: Our users can enjoy a big bridge discount by participating in our various marketing campaigns. In addition, they can also earn referral rewards in ETH and $pMNB whenever their referred address makes a transfer. Everything is transparent and Chaineye Mini Bridge is built for the community.\n\n\nProject Resource\nWebsite: https://minibridge.chaineye.tools/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Chaineye_tools\nTelegram: https://t.me/chaineye\nGithub: https://github.com/DeFiEye\nDocumentation: https://docs.chaineye.tools/\n \n",

          "description": "# growthepie.xyz 🥧📏\n\nWe are a public goods data platform designed specifically for Ethereum scaling solutions to analyze fundamentals as well as more detailed blockspace usage with a curated set of categories. Our goal is to empower builders and users alike by providing them with a comprehensive overview of fundamental metrics, onchain data, and educational resources, to help them make informed decisions when selecting their chain to build and interact on. We believe that real-world impact can only be achieved when people can select and use projects that fulfil their actual needs and when they know what’s out there. We achieve this through better transparency and overview of what’s happening in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe platform is and will stay free to use, striving to improve everyday through better UX and meaningful data. We do not have any VC funding or angel investment, nor do we have any subscription fee to access more data by individual users. All data can be seen and used (also via our API) free of charge. We are also completely open-source.\n\nWe also label smart contracts on Layer 2s, allowing tagging of usage type based on the Open Labels Initiative standard, which we co-founded are actively developing. \n\n![growthepie Landing Page](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-landingpage.gif \"growthepie Landing Page\")\n\n## In short\n\nPlatform Capabilities:\n\n- Fundamental Metrics and Chain Comparisons: We provide key metrics categorized into Activity, Value Locked, Economics, and Convenience.\n- Blockspace Explorer: This tool offers a detailed overview of blockspace usage across different Layer 2 chains showing how each chain is being used.\n- Smart Contract Label Overview & Suggestions: Users can view and suggest smart contract labels, contributing to the platform's community-driven aspect.\n- Single Chain Metrics: Comprehensive, chain-specific pages that showcase all metrics for a particular chain.\n- Public Goods Trackers: We develop and maintain several public goods trackers, like Optimism RetroFunding, Octant Epochs, and Glo Dollar holdings.\n\n## Our goals and usage of funds 🚀\n\n- Application-specific analytics: We want to go one level deeper and enable users to analyze individual projects (labeled smart contracts) in much more detail, for example their traction on different Layer 2s, fees of using them on either, etc.\n\n- More detailed transaction fees page: We are building on our most popular metric, and enhancing the data and transparency for our users by providing more detailed fees for transacting on the listed Layer 2s\n\n- More convenient analytics and sharing features: We continue to improve the UX to enable better analytics of metrics and chains, comparisons and also sharing of charts and tables for your own usage\n\n- Enhancing data with knowledge snippets: Tied with our metrics, we provide content for both developers and consumers to understand data and their specific use cases more. Also, what each of the events readable from data means for a specific Layer 2 and what this means compared to other L2 chains. Additional educational content for each metric brings data-based decision-making closer to each end-user/developer/investor.\n\n- Development of more impact trackers: We are working on enhancing our RPGF3 Tracker, and enable the same and better information overview for other impact projects. This development is in the early stages but fits our goal to provide better metrics and usability around data, as a public goods funded project.\n\n- Cross-reference applications/projects with their impact and funding: Since we are a public good and have lots of valuable data on projects (see goal above in this list), we aim to provide more visualizations and trackers on projects and their impact on users and the ecosystem in general. This can include OP RPGF, Gitcoin, Octant and other platforms providing data for us to visualize\n\n- Addition of more current and upcoming chains in the Ethereum ecosystem\n\n- Changing and maintaining infrastructure, adapting our Blockspace Explorer to Open Labels Initiative's data standard once the first version is defined\n\n\n## What can you do on our platform currently? 🧐\n\nCurrently, we provide a curated and easy-to-understand set of metrics for Layer 2s, focusing on 18 chains: Arbitrum One, Base, Blast, OP Mainnet, Immutable X, Linea, Loopring, Manta Pacific, Mantle, Metis, Polygon zkEVM, Public Goods Network, Redstone, rhino, Scroll, Starknet, Taiko, zkSync Era and Zora. All data has been pulled via RPC, some has been received from data providers or is linked to other sources. However, we are changing more and more to connecting our own RPC for better data quality and reliability.\n\n\n### Fundamental metrics Analysis\n\n**Activity**\n\n- Daily Active Addresses: The number of unique daily addresses that interacted with a chain.\n\n- Transaction Count: The number of daily transactions. We try to only count transactions that are executed by users/smart contracts, excluding system transactions.\n\n- Throughput: The number of daily transactions. We try to only count transactions that are executed by users/smart contracts - no system transactions.\n\n**Value Locked**\n\n- Stablecoin Market Cap: The sum of stablecoins that are locked on the chain.\n\n- Total Value Locked: The sum of all funds locked on the chain.\n\n**Economics**\n\n- Fees Paid by Users: The sum of fees that were paid by users of the chain in gas fees or, in the case of chains like Immutable X, the amount of fees that were paid to the protocol wallet.\n\n- Rent Paid to L1: The gas fees paid by L2s to post transaction data & verification states onto Ethereum.\n\n- Onchain Profit: The net profit of L2s, accounting for revenues as L2 gas fees collected and expenses as posting transaction data & verification states onto Ethereum.\n\n- Fully Diluted Valuation: The theoretical market cap of a token if all its planned tokens (total supply) were issued at the current price.\n\n- Market Cap: The total value of all circulating tokens, calculated by multiplying the current price of a single token by the total number of tokens in circulation.\n\n**Convenience**\n\n- Transaction Costs: The median amount that is paid per transaction.\n\n\n### fees.growthepie.xyz\n\nWe also have a more detailed and realtime updating fees page: https://fees.growthepie.xyz - allowing to view median and average fees, swap fees, transfer fees, transaction per second, and throughput live. \n\n![growthepie Realtime Fees](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-fees.gif \"growthepie Realtime Fees\")\n\n\n### Blockspace Explorer\n\nWith one rollup launching after the other, it is hard for users to understand what’s going on in the Ethereum ecosystem. Helping to analyze blockspace changes this trajectory.\n\n![growthepie Blockspace Explorer](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-blockspaceoverview.gif \"growthepie Blockspace Overview\")\n\nOur platform offers the following to Ethereum’s ecosystem:\n\n- An overview of chains’ high-level blockspace usage. All expressed in shares of a chain’s total blockspace. In simple words: For which purpose are these Layers 2s built and what do people do with them?\n\n- A comparison for available Layer 2s for their usage in specific categories, ranging from NFT, Token Transfers to Socials applications. For each of these and more categories, we have a set of subcategories that allow you to filter in more detail and compare which category is more used on which chain.\n\n- For each category/subcategory, users can see the most-used smart contracts ranked in a table and make sense of how the chain is being used\n\n![growthepie Blockspace Comparison](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-blockspacecomparison.gif \"growthepie Blockspace Comparison\")\n\n\n### Open Labels Initiative (OLI)\n\nIn order to ensure that people can make sense of all these Ethereum scaling solutions, we need to label smart contracts, i.e. projects that launch on the respective Layer 2s or Layer 3s. Currently, we label smart contracts ourselves. This is a huge effort, as every smart contract that is deployed needs to be researched, labeled, and verified. For this reason, we are building the Open Labels Initiative as one of the founding members, together with other contributors. This initiative aims to tackle the issue of isolated and non-standardized contract and wallet labeling datasets within the blockchain data community. By introducing a standardized data model for smart contract and wallet labels we advocate for the consolidation into a single, universally accessible data structure utilized by various data providers. Additionally, we also aim to function as an aggregator for labeling tools (i.e. automated ERC detection, activity tagging, etc.)\n\n\n### labels.growthepie.xyz\n\nWe recently launched our new labels page, dedicated to showcasing all labels on supported Layer 2 chains: https://labels.growthepie.xyz \n\n![growthepie Single Chain Metrics](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-labels.gif \"growthepie Labels\")\n\nUsers have the ability to filter down by chain, categories, subcategories as well as individual projects and types of contracts. Sorting by Transaction Count, Activity, etc. can also help identify new and exciting contracts/projects as well.\n\n\n### Smart Contract Label Suggestions\n\nOn our main platform users can already participate! Suggest smart contract labels and become an essential part of the pie. We will work on this feature to enable more community-based and open-source smart contract labeling.\n\n\n### Single Chain Metrics All-in-One\n\nYou can compare chains amongst each other with all the metrics mentioned. Additionally, you have chain-specific pages that allow you to have a glance at all metrics for a chain at once.\n\n![growthepie Single Chain Metrics](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-singlechain.gif \"growthepie Single Chain Metrics\")\n\n\n### Retroactive Public Goods Fund Tracker\n\nIn addition to aggregating data and providing fundamental metrics, we tracked projects and their impact for Optimism’s RPGF3 as well as Octant Epoch 3 & 4. This was the start of tracking impact for projects and providing transparency and overview of their achievements and previous funding.\n\nAdditionally, we worked with Glo Dollar to design a tracker for the main platform to showcase the Glo Dollar holders and spread the word about the stablecoin that funds public goods. \n\n\n\n## What funding have we received so far and how are we funded in the future? 💰\n- Ethereum Foundation Layer 2 Community Grants: USD ~79k\n- Ethereum Foundation Data Collection Grant 1: USD 30k (not fully paid yet)\n- Ethereum Foundation Data Collection Grant 2 (for Open Labels Initiative): USD 100k (not fully paid yet)\n- Optimism Builders grant: 35k OP (locked until August 2024)\n- Gitcoin GG18/GG19: USD ~2500\n- Gitcoin Arbitrum Funding Fest: ~800 ARB\n- Optimism RPGF3: ~76400 OP\n- Gitcoin GG20: ~ $3,600 from donations and matching pool\n- Giveth: ~ $250\n- New OP Builders Grants secured: 50,000 OP and 20,000 OP locked until end of 2025\n- Octant Epoch 3: ~ 52 ETH\n- Octant Epoch 4: ~ 1.14 ETH\n- Gitcoin GG21 + Web3 Ecosystem Advancement: ~ $2500\n- Giveth GIV-ARB: ~ $2700\n\n\n## The team (brief intro of each member) 👥\n\n- **Matthias**: Started to work in the blockchain/EVM space 5 years ago with his master thesis on the “Implementation of blockchain-based local energy markets”.

There isn’t a user interface yet, so our customers currently have to use Etherscan to set up ads. We already had some customers using them, but we want to make the UX much easier.\n\nWith the funding, we want to build a simple user interface to grow the revenue generated from these ads. We also want to work on designing and marketing the offer to customers. We’ve seen that providing white glove service to potential customers is a way to get them engaged in running a campaign.\n\n2) Drive growth to the product.\n\nThe unromantic reality of building a social media protocol is that without people using the product, there also won’t be anyone using the protocol. Hence, we are pursuing a dual-focus strategy. We believe in building the protocol over the long term, but short term this means making the product so good that it drives the usage of the protocol.\n\nAs for how to drive the product, this is based on adjusting configurations in the right places to increase retention, the onboarding throughput and so on. It’s not straight forward, but the processes is such that, one day, we actually become independent from being funded by grants.\n\n3) Harden the protocol.\n\nKiwi News is built on a p2p protocol. It needs constant maintenance with more and more people running nodes and using the product. Our goal here is to harden the protocol such that we are as good as possible prepared for when more people will start using us.\n",

          "description": "# LunCo was started as Opensource Software for Space Systems Engineering to design Lunar Settlement focused on engineering knowledge sharing.\n\nNow we are growing, and while the core technology is still there we are also started to work on:\n\n- OS AI Space Engineer based on LLama3\n- Lunar Opensource Lander / OS Space Hardware / OS Subsustems for Lunar Lander\n- And we are working hard to explore web3-native ways to to make opensource space missions a reality!\n- Collabs with space projects to help to onboard people from developing countries into space engineering (democratization/decentralization of space exploration)\n\n\n## [Browser version Dev Build](https://alpha.lunco.space)\n\n\n## [Download Dev Build](https://github.com/LunCoSim/lunco-sim/releases/tag/v0.4.0-dev1)\n\nThe below diagram highlights the overall idea.\n![Multiuser](https://bafybeic5mnsajdsyrszy7ddnoy5uvxhz76usukcnatp5g5exqapqagzcc4.ipfs.w3s.link/Combining%20simulations.png)\n\nLunCo is focused on **Data Sovereignty**, meaning that there is no need for central server. Users can run it locally, use it to edit their project, and then share it with the community using IP-NFTs for data discoverability, and decentralized data exchange networks like IPFS to share data itself.\n\n[![Multiuser](https://bafybeibdidgnutcuhqodxkvnh3qpecugyu6a7p6rvk7w36jwe5m4mtotty.ipfs.w3s.link/Federated.png)](https://twitter.com/LunCoSim/status/1679031437780201472)\n\n## Why Web3?\n\nWeb3 technology allows decentralization, which is crucial as engineering work is often dispersed across various teams. \n\nThe most common approach to knowledge sharing is email, which, while universal, is not the most efficient form of data exchange in today's digital age. On the other hand, Web3 provides advanced tools for file sharing and data exchange.\n\n![Multiuser](https://bafybeifuursjotnrriuy7sh2r7gf4k7mc4ob47nkmjnqj5h3m336a7moum.ipfs.w3s.link/Screenshot_20231105_151305.jpg)\n\n\n## Impact\n\nThrough LunCo, we aim to:\n\n- **Lower engineering costs,** by making knowledge sharing much more efficient\n- **Democratize the engineering landscape**, providing equal access to manufacturing software for all\n- **Foster a global engineering community** encouraging data and technology transfer across domains\n- Serve as a **repository of high-quality data for engineering AI**\n\n![](https://bafybeieyvd2guylnjom7lnyqcudcawsjnc2k5srr7a3j53jtswo6syww2m.ipfs.w3s.link/Screenshot_20231105_152202.jpg)\n\n\n## Main sybsystems\n\n- Solar Energy Design Subsystem\n- Networking sybsystems\n- Lunar Opensource Lander\n- AI Space Engineer\n\n## Inspired by\n\n1.

The parallels with social media giants earning billions from our data in exchange for free usage are stark. Crypto has to do better if we ever hope to bring about positive change in the world.\n\nGlo Dollar is proof that crypto can be better. It does what Tether and Circle **should** be doing with their billions: supporting public goods, grassroots initiatives, grant funding mechanisms, open source software, and ecological/social impact. There is absolutely no reason why it shouldn't be the default stablecoin for the industry. \n\nFor one, using USDGLO generates funding for projects often in short supply of capital. So much of the innovation in crypto wouldn't exist if it weren't for these grassroots funding initiatives.\n\nSecond, USDGLO is our chance to manifest the notion of programmable money. It's a term so often heard but rarely put into practice. We need better money; money that goes beyond a simple medium of exchange. By making it possible for holders to decide how reserve revenues are spent, Glo Dollar is money 2.0.\n\nThird, we haven't come up with an effective way to tackle poverty. One of the reasons is the reliance on donors - an unsustainable source of funds. We need new ways to get money into the hands of the impoverished without it feeling like a donation. What better way than to redirect revenue from US T-bills directly to those in need, just by using USDGLO.",

          "description": "We fill the information void in Web3 regenerative finance (ReFi) by providing a combination of news, education, expert analysis, industry reports, and project evaluation to help industry stakeholders better understand the space and to get projects more exposure.\n\nA core part of this is our comprehensive, curated ReFi company database. Each company has its own profile page complete with contact info, news, media coverage, content feed, token and fundraising data, and more. Each category in our taxonomy also has its own dedicated page showing aggregated data.\n\nAs part of our data efforts, we have launched a beta version of our ReFi Impact Dashboard which aims to aggregate and quantify the impact being made by projects in the space.\n\n# The ReFi Project Database\n\nOur database is a curated mapping of the Web3 regenerative finance space. We hope it will serve as a source of truth for the space and help new projects, in particular, establish an online footprint.\n\n## Features\n\nAll of the projects are accessible in one paged list:\n\n![ReFi project listing](https://carboncopy.news/images/db-article-list.png)\n\nEach project has its own dedicated profile page, including direct integration with Karma GAP milestones:\n\n![Project profile page](https://carboncopy.news/images/db-article-project.jpeg)\n\nEach category in our taxonomy has its own dedicated page with aggregated data:\n\n![Category page](https://carboncopy.news/images/db-article-category.jpg)\n\n# ReFi Impact Dashboard\n\nWe have started the aggregation and integration of the impact made by ReFi projects into a single dashboard. Metrics such as on-chain ecological credits issued, solar energy generated, and amount lent to regenerative projects can be tracked weekly.\n\n![ReFi Impact Dashboard](https://paragraph.xyz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.googleapis.com%2Fpapyrus_images%2F51c9776272e1edcec288db55b920ac1d.jpg&w=1920&q=75)\n\n# Other Activities\n\n**Industry Reports** - We released the 2024 editions of our cornerstone industry report, [The State of ReFi](https://carboncopy.news/reports/state-of-refi-2024/), in February in coordination with ReFi DAO and [The Impact DePIN Report](https://carboncopy.news/reports/impact-depin-2024/) in July in coordination with Arkreen, Switch Electric, and Shamba Network.\n\n**CARBON Copy Newsletter** - We have moved our own weekly newsletter to Paragraph. Every week, we highlight a trend or news item in ReFi that we think readers both inside and outside the space should know about. Example: [https://paragraph.xyz/@carboncopy/is-refai-the-future](https://paragraph.xyz/@carboncopy/is-refai-the-future)\n\n**Regenerative Self-Assessment** - We have launched a survey based on the research of [Kate Bennett](https://au.linkedin.com/in/ktlbennett) to help ReFi/Web3 projects become more regenerative in their organisation and impact. \n\n**Articles & Interviews** - We are slowly building a team of writers that produce rich analytical articles on ReFi topics, with a specific focus on localised impact. Example: [Exploring ReFi's Potential in Nigeria](https://carboncopy.news/features/exploring-refi-potential-nigeria/)\n\n**X Spaces** - Trinity Morphy, our staff writer, hosts a ReFi Weekly podcast every Friday where he discusses industry trends with ReFi's key opinion leaders.\n\n**Weekly ReFi recaps** - Trinity also now posts the ReFi Recap on the ReFi DAO blog every Monday. Example: [https://blog.refidao.com/refi-recap-01-13/](https://blog.refidao.com/refi-recap-01-13/)\n\n**ReFi News Feed** - We aggregate news from across the ReFi space into a single RSS feed that anyone can subscribe to or integrate into their projects. As the ReFi space grows, we see this as an important source of truth for crypto and tech media outlets.\n\n# Roadmap\n\nLooking forward, we are currently working on the following:\n\n## 1) Impact metric integration on project profile pages\n\nAt the heart of our mission is the desire to help ReFi projects demonstrate and promote their impact. To that end, we are working towards integrating impact data directly on the project profile and category profile pages. We have already integrated data for 20 projects.\n\n## 2) ReFi Impact Dashboard\n\nWe have launched the beta version and are now working on launching an updated version with more data connected and better interactivity.\n\n## 3) Community database management\n\nWe want the ReFi project database to remain a public good. As such, we are aiming for a community approach where decisions regarding the database are not made by us. This would involve allowing projects to claim their profile page by purchasing an NFT for a modest sum.\n\n## 4) 2025 editions of the State of ReFi and Impact DePIN reports\n\nWe aim to use this year's reports plus the data we are aggregating to produce richer, more insightful reports in 2025.\n\n## 5) Latin American and Southeast Asian content\n\nWe are looking to expand the geographic scope of our content and offer analysis from wherever ReFi is making impact.\n\n# Links\n\n**ReFi Project DB** - [https://carboncopy.news/projects/](https://carboncopy.news/projects/)\n\n**Impact Dashboard** - [https://carboncopy.news/dashboard/](https://carboncopy.news/dashboard/)\n\n**CARBON Copy Newsletter** - [https://paragraph.xyz/@carboncopy](https://paragraph.xyz/@carboncopy)\n\n**Regenerative Self-Assessment** - [https://carboncopy.news/regenerative-assessment/](https://carboncopy.news/regenerative-assessment/)\n\n**Discord** - [https://discord.gg/53TpqNgPC5](https://discord.gg/53TpqNgPC5)\n\n**CARBON Copy RSS Feed** - [https://carboncopy.news/feed.xml](https://carboncopy.news/feed.xml)\n\n**ReFi News RSS Feed** - [https://api.carboncopy.news/feed](https://api.carboncopy.news/feed)\n\n**LinkedIn** - [https://www.linkedin.com/company/carbon-copy-news/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/carbon-copy-news/)",

          "description": "# growthepie.xyz 🥧📏\n\nWe are a public goods data platform designed specifically for Ethereum scaling solutions to analyze fundamentals as well as more detailed blockspace usage with a curated set of categories. We also develop independent public goods trackers for Glo Dollar and Octant.\n\nOur goal is to empower builders and users alike by providing them with a comprehensive overview of fundamental metrics, onchain data, and educational resources, to help them make informed decisions when selecting their chain to build and interact on. \n\nWe believe that real-world impact can only be achieved when people can select and use projects that fulfil their actual needs and when they know what’s out there. We achieve this through better transparency and overview of what’s happening in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nThe platform is and will stay free to use, striving to improve everyday through better UX and meaningful data. We do not have any VC funding or angel investment, nor do we have any subscription fee to access more data by individual users. All data can be seen and used (also via our API) free of charge. We are also completely open-source.\n\nWe also label smart contracts on Layer 2s, allowing tagging of usage type based on the Open Labels Initiative standard, which we co-founded are actively developing. \n\n![growthepie Landing Page](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-landingpage.gif \"growthepie Landing Page\")\n\n## In short\n\nPlatform Capabilities:\n\n- Fundamental Metrics and Chain Comparisons: We provide key metrics categorized into Activity, Value Locked, and Convenience.\n- Economics view: We have a dedicated economics page to compare chains and their economic data, like revenue, cost, profit and margins.\n- Blockspace Explorer: This tool offers a detailed overview of blockspace usage across different Layer 2 chains showing how each chain is being used.\n- Smart Contract Label Overview & Suggestions: Users can view and suggest smart contract labels, contributing to the platform's community-driven aspect.\n- Single Chain Metrics: Comprehensive, chain-specific pages that showcase all metrics for a particular chain.\n- Public Goods Trackers: We develop and maintain several public goods trackers, like Optimism RetroFunding, Octant Epochs, and Glo Dollar holdings.\n\n## Our goals and usage of funds 🚀\n\n- Application-specific analytics: We want to go one level deeper and enable users to analyze individual projects (labeled smart contracts) in much more detail, for example their traction on different Layer 2s, fees of using them on either, etc.\n\n- More detailed transaction fees page: We are building on our most popular metric, and enhancing the data and transparency for our users by providing more detailed fees for transacting on the listed Layer 2s\n\n- More convenient analytics and sharing features: We continue to improve the UX to enable better analytics of metrics and chains, comparisons and also sharing of charts and tables for your own usage\n\n- Enhancing data with knowledge snippets: Tied with our metrics, we provide content for both developers and consumers to understand data and their specific use cases more. Also, what each of the events readable from data means for a specific Layer 2 and what this means compared to other L2 chains. Additional educational content for each metric brings data-based decision-making closer to each end-user/developer/investor.\n\n- Development of more impact trackers: We are working on enhancing our RPGF3 Tracker, and enable the same and better information overview for other impact projects. This development is in the early stages but fits our goal to provide better metrics and usability around data, as a public goods funded project.\n\n- Cross-reference applications/projects with their impact and funding: Since we are a public good and have lots of valuable data on projects (see goal above in this list), we aim to provide more visualizations and trackers on projects and their impact on users and the ecosystem in general. This can include OP RPGF, Gitcoin, Octant and other platforms providing data for us to visualize\n\n- Addition of more current and upcoming chains in the Ethereum ecosystem\n\n- Changing and maintaining infrastructure, adapting our Blockspace Explorer to Open Labels Initiative's data standard once the first version is defined\n\n\n## What can you do on our platform currently? 🧐\n\nCurrently, we provide a curated and easy-to-understand set of metrics for Layer 2s, focusing on 21 chains: Arbitrum One, Base, Blast, Derive, OP Mainnet, Orderly, Immutable X, Linea, Loopring, Manta Pacific, Mantle, Metis, Mode, Polygon zkEVM, Redstone, rhino, Scroll, Starknet, Taiko, zkSync Era and Zora. All data has been pulled via RPC, some has been received from data providers or is linked to other sources. However, we are changing more and more to connecting our own RPC for better data quality and reliability.\n\n\n### Fundamental metrics Analysis\n\n**Activity**\n\n- Daily Active Addresses: The number of unique daily addresses that interacted with a chain.\n\n- Transaction Count: The number of daily transactions. We try to only count transactions that are executed by users/smart contracts, excluding system transactions.\n\n- Throughput: The number of daily transactions. We try to only count transactions that are executed by users/smart contracts - no system transactions.\n\n**Value Locked**\n\n- Stablecoin Market Cap: The sum of stablecoins that are locked on the chain.\n\n- Total Value Locked: The sum of all funds locked on the chain.\n\n**Convenience**\n\n- Transaction Costs: The median amount that is paid per transaction.\n\n### Economics page\n\nOur Economics Page provides a comprehensive overview including table and historic charts of key financial metrics for all supported chains, including revenue, costs, profit, and margin. This allows users to gauge the economic health of the chain.\n\n**Individual Metrics**\n\n- Fees Paid by Users: The sum of fees that were paid by users of the chain in gas fees or, in the case of chains like Immutable X, the amount of fees that were paid to the protocol wallet.\n\n- Rent Paid to L1: The gas fees paid by L2s to post transaction data & verification states onto Ethereum.\n\n- Onchain Profit: The net profit of L2s, accounting for revenues as L2 gas fees collected and expenses as posting transaction data & verification states onto Ethereum.\n\n- Fully Diluted Valuation: The theoretical market cap of a token if all its planned tokens (total supply) were issued at the current price.\n\n- Market Cap: The total value of all circulating tokens, calculated by multiplying the current price of a single token by the total number of tokens in circulation.\n\n\n![growthepie Economics](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-economics.gif \"growthepie Economics\")\n\n### fees.growthepie.xyz\n\nWe also have a more detailed and realtime updating fees page: https://fees.growthepie.xyz - allowing to view median and average fees, swap fees, transfer fees, transaction per second, and throughput live. \n\n![growthepie Realtime Fees](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-fees.gif \"growthepie Realtime Fees\")\n\n\n### Blockspace Explorer\n\nWith one rollup launching after the other, it is hard for users to understand what’s going on in the Ethereum ecosystem. Helping to analyze blockspace changes this trajectory.\n\n![growthepie Blockspace Explorer](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-blockspaceoverview.gif \"growthepie Blockspace Overview\")\n\nOur platform offers the following to Ethereum’s ecosystem:\n\n- An overview of chains’ high-level blockspace usage. All expressed in shares of a chain’s total blockspace. In simple words: For which purpose are these Layers 2s built and what do people do with them?\n\n- A comparison for available Layer 2s for their usage in specific categories, ranging from NFT, Token Transfers to Socials applications. For each of these and more categories, we have a set of subcategories that allow you to filter in more detail and compare which category is more used on which chain.\n\n- For each category/subcategory, users can see the most-used smart contracts ranked in a table and make sense of how the chain is being used\n\n![growthepie Blockspace Comparison](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-blockspacecomparison.gif \"growthepie Blockspace Comparison\")\n\n\n### Smart Contract Labeling based Open Labels Initiative (OLI) standard\n\nIn order to ensure that people can make sense of all these Ethereum scaling solutions, we need to label smart contracts, i.e. projects that launch on the respective Layer 2s or Layer 3s. Currently, we label smart contracts ourselves. This is a huge effort, as every smart contract that is deployed needs to be researched, labeled, and verified. For this reason, we are building the Open Labels Initiative as one of the founding members, together with other contributors. This initiative aims to tackle the issue of isolated and non-standardized contract and wallet labeling datasets within the blockchain data community. By introducing a standardized data model for smart contract and wallet labels we advocate for the consolidation into a single, universally accessible data structure utilized by various data providers. Additionally, we also aim to function as an aggregator for labeling tools (i.e. automated ERC detection, activity tagging, etc.). All smart contracts that we labeled can be used by any third party for their own analysis or database. \n\n\n### labels.growthepie.xyz\n\nWe recently launched our new labels page, dedicated to showcasing all labels on supported Layer 2 chains: https://labels.growthepie.xyz \n\n![growthepie Single Chain Metrics](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-labels.gif \"growthepie Labels\")\n\nUsers have the ability to filter down by chain, categories, subcategories as well as individual projects and types of contracts. Sorting by Transaction Count, Activity, etc. can also help identify new and exciting contracts/projects as well.\n\n\n### Smart Contract Label Suggestions\n\nOn our main platform users can already participate! Suggest smart contract labels and become an essential part of the pie. We will work on this feature to enable more community-based and open-source smart contract labeling.\n\n\n### Single Chain Metrics All-in-One\n\nYou can compare chains amongst each other with all the metrics mentioned. Additionally, you have chain-specific pages that allow you to have a glance at all metrics for a chain at once.\n\n![growthepie Single Chain Metrics](https://api.growthepie.xyz/brand/product/gtp-singlechain.gif \"growthepie Single Chain Metrics\")\n\n\n### Retroactive Public Goods Fund Tracker\n\nIn addition to aggregating data and providing fundamental metrics, we tracked projects and their impact for Optimism’s RPGF3 as well as Octant Epoch 3 & 4. This was the start of tracking impact for projects and providing transparency and overview of their achievements and previous funding.\n\nAdditionally, we worked with Glo Dollar to design a tracker for the main platform to showcase the Glo Dollar holders and spread the word about the stablecoin that funds public goods. \n\n\n\n## What funding have we received so far and how are we funded in the future? 💰\n- Ethereum Foundation Layer 2 Community Grants: USD ~79k\n- Ethereum Foundation Data Collection Grant 1: USD 30k (not fully paid yet)\n- Ethereum Foundation Data Collection Grant 2 (for Open Labels Initiative): USD 100k (not fully paid yet)\n- Optimism Builders grant: 35k OP (locked until August 2024)\n- Gitcoin GG18/GG19: USD ~2500\n- Gitcoin Arbitrum Funding Fest: ~800 ARB\n- Optimism RPGF3: ~76400 OP\n- Gitcoin GG20: ~ $3,600 from donations and matching pool\n- Giveth: ~ $250\n- New OP Builders Grants secured: 50,000 OP and 20,000 OP locked until end of 2025\n- Octant Epoch 3: ~ 52 ETH\n- Octant Epoch 4: ~ 1.14 ETH\n- Gitcoin GG21 + Web3 Ecosystem Advancement: ~ $2500\n- Giveth GIV-ARB: ~ $2700\n- Gitcoin Octant Round 1: ~0.89 ETH\n- Gitcoin Metis QF round: ~144 METIS\n- Gitcoin GG22: ~ $17000\n\n\n## The team (brief intro of each member) 👥\n\n- **Matthias**: Started to work in the blockchain/EVM space 5 years ago with his master thesis on the “Implementation of blockchain-based local energy markets”.
