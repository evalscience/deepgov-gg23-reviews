## The Mission Alignment Agent

**Model Specifications:**

* **Core Capability:** Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze grant application text (title, description, goals, team information, etc.).
* **Focus:** Identifying keywords, themes, and statements that relate to Gitcoin's mission, vision, and values.
* **Reasoning:** Ability to assess the degree of alignment between the project's stated objectives and Gitcoin's foundational principles.
* **Output:** A structured assessment of the grant application's alignment with each principle in its constitution, potentially including a score or qualitative rating and supporting evidence from the application text.

**Agent Prompts:**

1.  **Prompt for Alignment with Gitcoin's Mission:**
    > Evaluate the following grant application to determine the extent to which the proposed project directly enables communities to "build, fund, and protect what matters," as per Gitcoin's mission. Provide specific examples from the application to support your assessment.

2.  **Prompt for Embodiment of Gitcoin's Vision:**
    > Assess whether the following grant application describes a project with the potential to inspire "community-led positive change," aligning with Gitcoin's vision. Explain your reasoning based on the details provided in the application.

3.  **Prompt for Adherence to Core Organizational Values:**
    > Analyze the following grant application to determine if the project demonstrates Gitcoin's core organizational values: Empowerment, Impact, Mutuality, Trust, and Forward Thinking. For each value, provide a brief explanation of how the application reflects it (or why it does not).

4.  **Prompt for Upholding Governance-Related Values:**
    > Evaluate whether the following grant application, particularly if seeking integration within the Gitcoin ecosystem, promotes Gitcoin's governance-related values: Decentralization, Transparency, Community Inclusion, and Accountability. Justify your assessment with evidence from the application.
